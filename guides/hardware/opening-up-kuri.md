## Goal
Remove Kuri's front shell so that you can get at her main board.

## Overview
To get at the inside of Kuri's torso, we will remove both arm plates, unscrew
the screws underneath, then pop the front shells off and unhook the cables
connecting the shells to the rest of Kuri.

## Removing Kuri's arm plates
Kuri's arm plates (the grey things to both sides) are only held on by snap-fit.
You can pop them off by sticking a spudger (or a flat-head screwdriver, or
even a pen) in the crack between the bottom right (or left) edge of the grey
plate and the black speaker grill, and wedging it outwards.

Once the arm plates are off, unscrew the screws on the side closest to Kuri's
front.  Also remove the screw holding the speaker grill on, then slide
the speaker grill upwards to remove it.  Now unscrew the screw on the side
closest to Kuri's front that was underneath the speaker grill.

## Removing Kuri's front torso shells
Kuri's front torso shells (both the white top and the black bottom shells) are
only held on by snap-fit.  Put Kuri on the ground, facing you, and grab
both top and bottom shells at once, on both sides.  Pull outwards and towards
you, wiggling (and deforming slightly) the plates to release all the
snap-fit attachments.  Be careful with the connecting cables as you pull
the shells off.

## Detaching cables
Detach all the cables between the shells and Kuri's torso, noting carefully
the original orientation of the microphone cables (the microphones are the
things on the other side of the four tiny holes around the neck), since
those are easy to accidentally re-connect backwards.  Note also how the one
cable to the depth sensor goes through a cable-guide loop.

## Main board connections
Now that Kuri's main board is exposed, there are two easy connection points
of interest: one is the serial debug port, which you can use with a
custom serial cable (see the ``Making and using a debug cable`` guide).
The other is the open USB 3.0 port, which you can use to hook up USB devices
to Kuri's main computer.

## Removing Kuri's rear torso shells
Kuri's rear torso shells can be removed in much the same way as the front shells--
unscrew the rest of the screws under the arm plates, then grab the rear
white and black shells and pull outwards and towards you.
